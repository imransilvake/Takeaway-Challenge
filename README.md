# Takeaway Challenge
Takeaway Challenge is a single and multiplayer game challenge given by Lieferando using React, Redux, Firebase, and custom SCSS Framework. A random number is generated in the gameplay and players have to make that number divisible by 3 with the following options: -1, 0, +1. The Player who gets 1 in the end will be the winner.

- Use of Firebase Real-time Database to create a single and multi-player game
